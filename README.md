Aprendiendo a usar GitHub

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.

Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.

## To create a new branch
0- Go to your new repository hello-world.
1- Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
2- Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
3- Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

## Step 3. Make and commit changes
Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your readme-edits branch, which is a copy of master. Let’s make some edits.

## Make and commit changes
1- Click the README.md file.
2- Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
3- In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4- Write a commit message that describes your changes.
5- Click Commit changes button.

## Step 4. Open a Pull Request
Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request. Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

## Open a Pull Request for changes to the README
Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
