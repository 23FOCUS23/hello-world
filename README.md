Aprendiendo a usar GitHub

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.

Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.

## To create a new branch

1- Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
2- Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
3- Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

## Step 3. Make and commit changes
Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your readme-edits branch, which is a copy of master. Let’s make some edits.
