Aprendiendo a usar GitHub

By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.

Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.

## To create a new branch
0- Go to your new repository hello-world.
1- Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
2- Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
3- Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.
1- Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
2- Click Confirm merge.
3- Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
